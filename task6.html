        <h1>Task 6:</h1>
        <p>
            Paragraph 1:
        </p>
        <p id="small_text">
            Under the glistening night sky, the city came alive with a symphony of twinkling lights. Skyscrapers reached for the heavens, their illuminated windows forming a mosaic of colors against the obsidian canvas above. The bustling streets below hummed with energy, as people from all walks of life meandered along the sidewalks, their footsteps blending with the distant echoes of laughter and car horns. In the midst of this urban spectacle, a lone street musician played a melancholic melody on his weathered guitar, his soulful notes weaving through the air, carrying the weight of countless stories and dreams.

            Paragraph 2:
        </p>
        <p class="red-text">
            In the heart of the ancient forest, sunlight filtered through a lush canopy of emerald leaves, dappling the forest floor with patches of gold. Birds of vibrant plumage danced through the foliage, their melodic songs interweaving with the gentle rustle of leaves and the distant murmur of a babbling brook. A sense of timelessness pervaded the atmosphere, as towering trees stood as ancient sentinels, their bark bearing the marks of centuries gone by. Amidst this natural cathedral, a delicate carpet of wildflowers unfolded, a tapestry of colors that seemed to mirror the hues of the setting sun, painting the scene in a serene and enchanting palette.

            Paragraph 3:
        </p>
        <p style="color: red;"> 
            Amidst the swirling mist of an enigmatic realm, a forgotten castle emerged like a spectral apparition. Its weathered stone walls told tales of forgotten eras, adorned with intricate carvings that had withstood the test of time. The castle's towering spires seemed to reach into the very heavens, and as night descended, an ethereal glow emanated from its windows, hinting at the secrets held within. A lone figure, cloaked in mystery, stood at the castle's entrance, a sentinel of the past and the keeper of the enigmas that whispered through the ages.
